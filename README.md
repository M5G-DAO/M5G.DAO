# 🌐 M5G Project - DAO for Decentralized 5G Infrastructure

> Democratizing access to 5G connectivity through a community-led, sustainable, blockchain-based platform.

## 📘 Overview

**M5G** is an open-source initiative aiming to build decentralized 5G infrastructure. The project uses blockchain technology to coordinate deployment, management, and monetization of local 5G networks through a DAO (Decentralized Autonomous Organization).

By leveraging Location NFTs (LNFTs) and Equipment NFTs (ENFTs), M5G empowers communities, municipalities, and investors to actively participate in a new, democratized telecom model.

## 🚀 Core Components

* **M5G DAO**: Governance mechanisms for community-led decisions.
* **Tokens & NFTs**: Represent participation, ownership, and infrastructure access.
* **Avalanche Subnet**: High-performance blockchain with low fees and scalability.
* **5G Infrastructure**: Small cells, gateways, and telemetry linked to NFTs.
